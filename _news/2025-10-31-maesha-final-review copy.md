H2020 [MAESHA project](https://maesha.eu/) is also officially closed. It was a challenging project with lots of barriers to overcome, but also with valuable learnings in the end. In the last days of the project, I've participated in the [Greening the Islands](https://greeningtheislands.org/events/10th-gti-international-conference-malta-2025/) conference in Gozo, Malta.

In this project I was developing flexibility market framework for geographical islands and `Virtual Power Plant` consisting of residential air conditioning units and solar photovoltaic inverters providing peak load reduction and balancing services.

See FLEXCON 2025 presentation for the summary:
