### Project objective

HEILA project aimed to define, implement and demonstrate an integrated business platform of DERs for information exchange between energy market participants. Development of such a system begins as a national smart grid demonstration platform in Finland but will be designed to support Europe wide deployment of the system.

### My Role in the project

I was participating in definition of a scalable smart grid architecture able to support integration of DERs into different business models of electrical power system using SGAM use case methodology. Furthermore, I contributed to the programming of control agents for microgrid operator of LUT LVDC microgrid and DER operator managing battery energy storage system. The final report is available [here](https://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/159974).
