Hi there :wave:,

I work on the behind-the-meter `flexibility optimisation` with focus in the Energy Forecasting and Operations Research at `Centrica`. My professional goal is to contribute to the development of scalable algorithms coordinating participation of millions of small-scale energy resources in energy markets and grid ancillary services for a more flexible, cost-efficient, and reliable operation of a low-carbon power system.

My main interests are in
- Sequential decision-making in power markets
- Data-driven probabilistic energy forecasting
- Power grid modeling
- Energy informatics
