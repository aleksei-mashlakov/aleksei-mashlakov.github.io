### Project objective

The main objective of MAESHA (`deMonstration of smArt and flExible solutions for a decarboniSed energy future in Mayotte and other European islAnds`) is to decarbonise the energy systems of geographical islands by fostering the large deployment of RES through the installation of tailored innovative flexibility services based on a close study and modelling of local energy systems and community structures. 

MAESHA will demonstrate the solutions on the French overseas island of Mayotte and study replicability potential on 5 follower islands representing more than 1.2 million inhabitants spread in geographical Europe and overseas territories.
