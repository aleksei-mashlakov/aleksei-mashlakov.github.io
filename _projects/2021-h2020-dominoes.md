### Project objective

[`DOMINOES` (*"Smart Distribution Grid: a Market Driven Approach for the Next Generation of Advanced Operation Models and Services"*) project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/771066) aimed to enable the discovery and development of new demand response, aggregation, grid management and peer-to-peer trading services by designing, developing, and validating a transparent and scalable `local energy market` solution.

***

### Project partners

It is a European research project supported by Horizon 2020 and developed by `Enerim (coordinator – Finland)`, `E-REDES (CNET and EDP Distribution)`, `ISEP (GECAD)`, `Lappeenranta University of Technology – LUT (Finland)`, `VPS (UK)`, `University of Leicester – UoL (UK)`, and `University of Seville (Spain)`.

### My Role in the project

I was involved into the integration of LUT LVDC microgrids’ energy management systems (`EMSs`) to the local market service platform (`LMSP`) for validation of use case (UC) 5 “Local community flexibility and energy asset management for wholesale and energy system market value”. In this scenario, the aggregator offers flexibility of microgrids (`prosumers`) for sale to reserve markets through the local energy and flexibility market (`LEFM`). 

To integrate and validate the microgrids’ EMSs into the local market service platform (LMSP) environment, I have developed components of the aggregator platform including forecast, simulation & optimization, control, and settlement services. The results of the use case validation and description of the developed services are presented in [D4.4 Distribution Grid and Microgrid Validation Activities Report](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5df2a964e&appId=PPGMS).
