**Hi there!** :wave:

I am a Researcher in Demand Response / Flexibility with focus in the Energy Forecasting and Operations Research at `Centrica`. My goal is to explore the technological means to enable coordinated participation of small-scale energy resources in energy markets and grid ancillary services for a more flexible, cost-efficient, and reliable operation of a low-carbon power system.

I am interested in
- Data-driven probabilistic energy forecasting
- Multi-agent optimization under uncertainty
- Power grid modeling
- Energy informatics
