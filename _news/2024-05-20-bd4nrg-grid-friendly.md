H2020 [BD4NRG project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/872613) is also officially closed. 

In this project I was developing and validating `grid-friendly` flexibility activation method for residential demand response assets relying on the high-resolution locally retrieved grid data. The deliverable `8.2 - LSP 5 Documentation` describing the concept, which I co-authored, is published.
