Had an awesome time presenting at the 19th IEEE Power Symposium 'Energy Flexibility - Close to the Consumer'.

🚀 Shared insights on how Centrica Demand Side Response team is contributing to a low carbon power system at the lowest cost.

🌍 Big shoutout to fellow speakers Axel Meeuwissen, Pierre Crucifix, Marijn Maenhoudt, and Achille H. for their inspiring perspectives! 

💡 And kudos to Prof. Geert Deconinck for keeping the panel session lively! Wish we had more time to dive deeper into discussions.

🙌 Huge thanks to the enthusiastic students at KU Leuven for making the event a hit!
