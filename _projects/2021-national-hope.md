### Project objective

Aim of the research in [HOPE (Highly Optimized Energy Systems) project](https://hopeproject.fi/) is to develop tools and solutions for the `multi-objective optimization of energy systems` by considering the operating conditions and uncertainty. This enables optimization to be adapted to the prevailing conditions. Use of advanced weather forecasts aims to improve predictions on the state of energy devices and enable the inclusion of the uncertainty in the optimization. The integration of heat and electricity including production, distribution and demand aims to more efficient energy systems.

### My Role in the project

I was in charge of data-driven energy profiling of residential customers relying on the idea of energy energy signature (see below). The profiling was based on smart meter readings and was intended to discover the amount of flexibility that could be provided by the customer heating systems and identify the type of heating system installed in the customer households.
