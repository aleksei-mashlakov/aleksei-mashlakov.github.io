Last week I had a chance to visit [Energy Innovation Summit 2023](https://www.energyinnovationsummit.org.uk/) in Liverpool. The Summit attracts innovators from the energy sector from across the world and is the UKâ€™s flagship knowledge dissemination event for the electricity and gas energy network operators. The main topics were around the connection queues, flexibility mechanisms, and network issues.
