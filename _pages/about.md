Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am a Researcher in Demand Response / Flexibility with focus in the Energy Forecasting and Operations Research at `Centrica`. My goal is to explore the technological means to enable coordinated participation of small-scale energy resources in energy markets and grid ancillary services for a more flexible, cost-efficient, and reliable operation of a low-carbon power system.

I am interested in
- Data-driven probabilistic energy forecasting
- Multi-agent optimization under uncertainty
- Power grid modeling
- Energy informatics
